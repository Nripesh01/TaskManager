APIView
APIView is the base class for all class-based views in DRF.
You can define any method (get, post, put, delete, etc.) manually.
Gives full control over how the view behaves.
Use APIView → when your logic is custom (like login with JWT).or Use it when your view needs custom behavior that the generic views cannot provide.

DRF does not have a built-in generic view for login, because login usually involves:
   Authenticating user credentials
   Creating JWT tokens
   Returning a custom response
So you write this custom logic inside post().


Response
Response is like Django’s HttpResponse, but designed for APIs.
It automatically converts Python objects to JSON using DRF renderers.
You use it in DRF views to send data back to the client.


status 
DRF provides named constants for HTTP status codes.
Makes your code more readable than writing numbers like 200, 400, 404.
     status.HTTP_201_CREATED → 201
     status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST → 400



generics is a module inside DRF. → for standard CRUD
Use generics → when you just want standard CRUD behavior (like creating or listing users/tasks).

GenericAPIView:
GenericAPIView is a class inside the generics module: GenericAPIView inherits from APIView
    (from rest_framework.generics import GenericAPIView)
GenericAPIView is the base class that all the pre-built generic views inherit from.

Inside this module, you have classes like:
Generic View	                           Methods	                                Purpose
CreateAPIView	                           POST	                                  Create object
ListAPIView	                               GET	                                 List all objects
RetrieveAPIView	                           GET	                              Retrieve single object
UpdateAPIView	                         PUT/PATCH	                              Update object
DestroyAPIView	                           DELETE	                              Delete object
ListCreateAPIView	                     GET, POST	                              List + create
RetrieveUpdateAPIView	              GET, PUT/PATCH	                        Retrieve + update
RetrieveDestroyAPIView	               GET, DELETE	                            Retrieve + delete
RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView	   GET, PUT/PATCH,DELETE 	                 Full CRUD for one object

purpose: Provides ready-to-use views for CRUD operations.

GenericAPIView Does NOT implement HTTP methods (get, post, put, delete) but Gives you all the generic features you need for CRUD operations:

Feature	                                                                 Purpose
queryset                                                           Fetch objects from DB
get_queryset()	                                               allows dynamic filtering based on request, user, or query params.
serializer_class                                                  Serialize/deserialize objects
get_serializer()	                          get_serializer() is a method provided by GenericAPIView to create a serializer instance.
lookup_field / get_object()	                                         Retrieve single object safely
Pagination	                                                           Split results into pages
Filtering & Search	                                                  Filter or search querysets
Permissions	                                                         Control who can access the view
Authentication	                                                        Enforce login/JWT, etc.
Serializer context                                                  Pass request/view info to serializer

GenericAPIView does not implement HTTP methods (get, post, etc.)
Pre-built generics like ListAPIView, CreateAPIView inherit from it and use all these features while implementing the HTTP methods automatically.



RefreshToken:
Part of DRF Simple JWT, used for JWT authentication.
JWT tokens include:
Access token → short-lived, used to access API endpoints
Refresh token → long-lived, used to generate a new access token



permission_classes & permissions:
permission_classes is a decorator or attribute that tells DRF which permissions to enforce for that view.
Permissions control who can access an API endpoint.

Common DRF permissions:
AllowAny → anyone can access
IsAuthenticated → only logged-in users can access
IsAdminUser → only admin users
